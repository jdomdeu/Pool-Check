## Performance Tests

This is the repository for scripts to Short Term Historic (STH), used for Performance tests. Load testing is the process
of putting demand on a system and measuring its response. Load testing is performed to determine a system's behavior
under anticipated peak load conditions

#### Pre-conditions:

-   "Jmeter" app exists in Launcher VM
-   "ServerAgent" app exists in STH Nodes and Balancer (only in cluster case)
-   have a account in [Loadosophia](http://loadosophia.org)
-   "nginx" app exists in Balancer VM (only in cluster case)
-   Verify nginx configuration for each scenario (only in cluster case)
-   Verify that the mongoDB exists and it is installed correctly

#### Pre-steps:

-   Launch "ServerAgent" in Balancer or/and each STH Node VMs (java is a dependency)

```console
nohup sh startAgent.sh --udp-port 0 --tcp-port 4444 &
```

#### Scripts:

**sth_notifications.jmx**:

> **Scenario**:

```text
* Multiples Notifications at the same time against a STH instance specific during a given time.
* Ten services always will be used in parallel, therefore:
      notifications TOTAL = 10 Services (threads groups) *  THREADS (retries during a given time)
      service path / entities postfix = THREADS / ENTITIES (in each service path) (see properties)
      Example (a given data set:):
        THREADS = 1000
        ENTITIES = 100
        service path / entity id postfix are incremental until equal to 10
```

> **Steps**:

```text
-  verify mongo is installed correctly
-  STH configuration (by command line or config file)
-  restart STH app or service
-  launch jmeter script
-  reports path (/tmp/JMeter_result/<TESTNAME>_result_<date>)
```

> **Properties**:

```text
* TESTNAME       - test name (notifications by default)
* HOST           - IP or hostname main node(in case of clusters is Nginx)  (127.0.0.1 by default)
* PORT           - port used by sth (8666 by default)
* RAMPUP         -  ramp up of threads (0 by default)
* THREADS        - threads number (notifications total) (1 by default)
* ENTITIES       - number of entities in each service path  (1 by default, service path and entity id are the div between notifications (THREADS) and ENTITIES)
* RUNTIME        - duration time of the test (1 sec by default)
* SERVICE        - service or tenant name prefix (my_service by default)
* SERVICE_PATH   - service path name prefix (/my_serv_path by default)
* ENTITY_TYPE    - entity type value (static value) (house by default)
* ENTITY_ID      - entity id prefix (room by default)
* ATTR_NAME      - attribute name (temperature by default)
* MAX_ATTR_VALUE - maximum attribute value, is used to generate random value (100 by default)
* ATTR_TYPE      - attribute value (float by default)
```

> **example**:

```text
<jmeter_path>/jmeter.sh -n -t <path>/sth_notifications_v1.0.jmx -JHOST=X.X.X.X -JPORT=7777 -JRAMPUP=10 -JTHREADS=20 -JENTITIES=5 -JRUNTIME=10 > <log_path>/sth_notifications_`date +%FT%T`.log &
```

#### Post-steps:

-   Upload in Loadosophia web `Loadosophia_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.jtl.gz` and `perfmon_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.jtl.gz`
    (where `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` is a hash value).
-   Create Final Report (recommend google docs)

```text
Comments:
    /tmp/error_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.html is created, because does not have access at loadosophia, the token is wrong intentionally
    This is made to not constantly access and penalizes the test times. We only store dates manually when finished test. So "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" is a hash value.
```
