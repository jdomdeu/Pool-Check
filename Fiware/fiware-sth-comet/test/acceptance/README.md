# STH Acceptance Tests

Folder for acceptance tests of STH (Short Term Historic).

## How to Run the Acceptance Tests

### Prerequisites:

-   Python 2.6 or newer
-   pip installed (http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/linux/)
-   virtualenv installed (pip install virtualenv) (optional). Note: We recommend the use of virtualenv, because is an
    isolated working copy of Python which allows you to work on a specific project without worry of affecting other
    projects.

##### Environment preparation:

-   If you are going to use a virtual environment (optional):
    -   Create a virtual environment somewhere, e.g. in ~/venv (virtualenv ~/venv) (optional)
    -   Activate the virtual environment (source ~/venv/bin/activate) (optional)
-   Both if you are using a virtual environment or not:
    -   Change to the test/acceptance folder of the project.
    -   Install the requirements for the acceptance tests in the virtual environment
        ```console
        pip install -r requirements.txt --allow-all-external
        ```
    -   Verify if xmltodict and requests libraries are installed, if not:
        ```console
        pip install xmltodict requests
        ```

#### Requirements to fabric

    ```console
     yum install gcc python-devel
    ```

### Tests execution:

-   Change to the test/acceptance folder of the project if not already on it.
-   `properties.json` will be create automatically from setting folder (see configuration.json), with configurations
    files previously created
-   Run lettuce_tools (see available params with the -h option).

```text
Some examples:
   lettuce_tools                                   -- run all features
   lettuce_tools -ft ckan_row.feature              -- run only one feature
   lettuce_tools -tg test -ft ckan_row.feature     -- run scenarios tagged with "test" in a feature
   lettuce_tools -tg=-skip -ft ckan_row.feature    -- run all scenarios except tagged with "skip" in a feature
```

### Tests Suites Coverage:

-   notifications.
-   aggregated.
-   raw.
-   alarms (pending)

### configuration.json

We recommend to create `settings` folder in acceptance folder if it does not exists and store all configurations to
features referenced by `properties.json.base` files. The settings folder path could be changed in the
`configuration.json` file in `path_to_settings_folder` field This file initially will overwrite properties.json in each
feature.

```text
ex: epg_config.txt
```

-   path_to_settings_folder: path where are stored all configurations referenced by properties.json.base
-   log_file: path and file where is log file
-   jenkins: it is used mainly per not jenkins environment (false) and the properties will be read from config file in
    `path_to_settings_folder`. If jenkins (true) won't read config file previously and properties must be provisioned in
    consoles jenkins.

### checking log file

Verify if a label and its text exists in the last lines. The file log by default is `"/var/log/sth/sth.log`(see
configuration.json)

    -   sth_verify_version: determine whether the version is verified or not (True or False).
    -   sth_fabric_user: user used to connect by Fabric
    -   sth_fabric_password: password used to connect by Fabric, if use password, cert_file must be None.
    -   sth_fabric_cert_file: cert_file used to connect by Fabric, if use cert file, password must be None.
    -   sth_fabric_error_retry: Number of times Fabric will attempt to connect when connecting to a new server
    -   sth_fabric_source_path: source path where are templates files
    -   sth_fabric_target_path: target path where are copied config files
    -   sth_fabric_sudo: with superuser privileges (True | False)

### tags

You can to use multiples tags in each scenario, possibles tags used:

-   `happy_path`, `skip`, `errors_40x`, `only_master`, `ISSUE_XXX`, `BUG_XXX`, etc

and to filter scenarios by these tags: see Tests execution section.
