Feature: Store in mongo new notifications from context broker in raw and aggregated format
  As a sth user
  I want to be able to Store in mongo new notifications from context broker in raw and aggregated format
  so that they become more functional and useful

  @happy_path
  Scenario: stored new notifications in mongo from context broker with metadata
    Given service "test_happy_path", service path "/test", entity type "room", entity_id "room2", with attribute number "1", attribute name "random" and attribute type "celcius"
    When receives a notification with attributes value "random number=2", metadata value "True" and content "json"
    Then validate that the attribute value and type are stored in mongo
    And validate that the aggregated value is generate by resolution "month" in mongo

  @resolutions
  Scenario Outline: stored new notifications in mongo from context broker with metadata with several resolutions
    Given service "test_resolutions", service path "/test", entity type "room", entity_id "room2", with attribute number "1", attribute name "random" and attribute type "celcius"
    When receives a notification with attributes value "random number=2", metadata value "True" and content "json"
    Then validate that the attribute value and type are stored in mongo
    And validate that the aggregated value is generate by resolution "<resolution>" in mongo
  Examples:
    | resolution |
    | month      |
    | day        |
    | hour       |
    | minute     |
    | second     |

  @service
  Scenario Outline:  stored new notifications in mongo from context broker with metadata with several services
    Given service "<service>", service path "/test", entity type "room", entity_id "room2", with attribute number "1", attribute name "random" and attribute type "celcius"
    When receives a notification with attributes value "random number=2", metadata value "True" and content "json"
    Then validate that the attribute value and type are stored in mongo
    And validate that the aggregated value is generate by resolution "month" in mongo
    And delete database in mongo
  Examples:
    | service                    |
    | test_orga60100             |
    | test_ORGA60111             |
    | test_Org_61401             |
    | random service length = 50 |

  @service_path
  Scenario Outline:  stored new notifications in mongo from context broker with metadata with several service_paths
    Given service "test_service_path", service path "<service_path>", entity type "room", entity_id "room2", with attribute number "1", attribute name "random" and attribute type "celcius"
    When receives a notification with attributes value "random number=2", metadata value "True" and content "json"
    Then validate that the attribute value and type are stored in mongo
    And validate that the aggregated value is generate by resolution "month" in mongo
  Examples:
    | service_path                    |
    | serv6010                        |
    | SERV6012                        |

    | 1234567890                      |
    | /1234567890                     |
    | /                               |
    | random service path length = 50 |

  @entity_type
