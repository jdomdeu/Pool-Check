Feature: get raw values with differents requests from sth
  As a sth user
  I want to be able to get raw values with differents requests from sth
  so that they become more functional and useful


  @happy_path
  Scenario: get raw values using sth
    Given service "test_happy_path", service path "/test", entity type "room", entity_id "room2", with attribute number "1", attribute name "random" and attribute type "celcius"
    And receives "3" notifications with consecutive values beginning with "51" and with step one
    When ask for raw with queries parameters
      | parameter | value               |
      | hLimit    | 10                  |
      | hOffset   | 0                   |
      | dateFrom  | 2015-02-14T00:00:00 |
      | dateTo    | 2015-12-31T00:00:00 |
