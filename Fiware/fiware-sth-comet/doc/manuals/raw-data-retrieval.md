# Getting historical raw context information

The STH component exposes an HTTP REST API to let external clients query the available historical raw context
information.

A typical URL querying for this information using a `GET` request is the following:

```text
http://<sth-host>:<sth-port>/STH/v2/entities/<entityId>/attrs/<attrName>?type=<entityType>&hLimit=3&hOffset=0&dateFrom=2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z&dateTo=2016-01-31T23:59:59.999Z
```

Notice that in the previous URL we have used some templates between `<` and `>` which should be substituted by the
corresponding real values.

Also notice that in the previous request a paginated response has been requested with a limit of 3 entries and an offset
of 0 entries (first page).

The requests for raw context information can use the following query parameters:

-   **lastN**: Only the requested last entries will be returned. It is a mandatory parameter if no `hLimit` and
    `hOffset` are provided.
-   **hLimit**: In case of pagination, the number of entries per page. It is a mandatory parameter if no `lastN` is
    provided.
-   **hOffset**: In case of pagination, the offset to apply to the requested search of raw context information. It is a
    mandatory parameter if no `lastN` is provided.
-   **dateFrom**: The starting date and time from which the raw context information is desired. It is an optional
    parameter.
-   **dateTo**: The final date and time until which the raw context information is desired. It is an optional parameter.
-   **file type**: The raw context information can be requested as a file setting this query parameter to the desired
    file type. Currently, the only supported value and file type is `csv`. It is an optional parameter.
-   **count**: The total count of elements could be asked using this query parameter. Supported values are `true` or
    `false`. As a result response will include a new header: Fiware-Total-Count. It is an optional parameter which
    default is `false`.

**NOTE**: Date is specified using the [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) standard format.

In order to avoid problems handing big results there is a restriction about the number of results per page that could be
retrieved. The rule is `hLimit <= lastN <= config.maxPageSize` Where default max page is are defined to 100.

An example response provided by the STH component to a request such as the previous one could be the following:

```json
{
    "type": "StructuredValue",
    "values": [
        {
            "recvTime": "2016-01-14T13:43:33.306Z",
            "attrValue": "21.28"
        },
        {
            "recvTime": "2016-01-14T13:43:34.636Z",
            "attrValue": "23.42"
        },
        {
            "recvTime": "2016-01-14T13:43:35.424Z",
            "attrValue": "22.12"
        }
    ]
}
```

It is important to note that if a valid query is made but it returns no data (for example because there is no raw
context information for the specified time frame), a response with code `200` is returned including an empty `values`
property array, since it is a valid query.

## Deprecated API

There is an alternative method based in old V1 API. However, this is deprecated functionality, included here for the
sake of completeness. You are encouraged to not using it, as it can be removed in a future STH version.

Alternative URL:

```text
http://<sth-host>:<sth-port>/STH/v1/contextEntities/type/<entityType>/id/<entityId>/attributes/<attrName>?hLimit=3&hOffset=0&dateFrom=2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z&dateTo=2016-01-31T23:59:59.999Z
```

Example response:

```json
{
    "contextResponses": [
        {
            "contextElement": {
                "attributes": [
                    {
                        "name": "attrName",
                        "values": [
                            {
                                "recvTime": "2016-01-14T13:43:33.306Z",
                                "attrValue": "21.28"
                            },
                            {
                                "recvTime": "2016-01-14T13:43:34.636Z",
                                "attrValue": "23.42"
                            },
                            {
                                "recvTime": "2016-01-14T13:43:35.424Z",
                                "attrValue": "22.12"
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                ],
                "id": "entityId",
                "isPattern": false
            },
            "statusCode": {
                "code": "200",
                "reasonPhrase": "OK"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
